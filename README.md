##Introduction

microphork is a small and very flexible MVC framework for PHP 5.3 and above. It includes an API framework, automatic URL routing, language localization, and several useful utilities and extensions. Parts of microphork are based on the [Phork Framework](http://phork.org) but it has mostly been written from the ground up.

The best way to start a new microphork project is to use the Composer-based [microphork application](https://github.com/phork/microphork-application) package, however it's also possible to use it as a standalone framework. All application code should go in the `app` folder.
