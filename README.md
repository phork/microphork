##Introduction

microphork is a small and very flexible MVC framework for PHP 5.3 and above. It includes an API framework, automatic URL routing, language localization, a stack-based loader and several useful utilities and extensions. Parts of microphork are based on the [Phork Framework](http://phork.org) but it has mostly been written from the ground up.

> The best way to start a new microphork project is to use the Composer-based [microphork application](https://github.com/phork/microphork-application) package. 

All application code should go in the `app` folder.
